    """Apply vmap such that func can be evaluated on choices and simulation states.

    This function maps the function `func` over the simulation state-choice-space. That
    is, it maps `func` over the Cartesian product of the choice variables, and over the
    fixed simulation states. For each choice variable, a leading dimension is added to
    the output object, with the length of the axis being the number of possible values
    in the grid. Importantly, it does not create a Cartesian product over the state
    variables, since these are fixed during the simulation. For the state variables,
    a single dimension is added to the output object, with the length of the axis
    being the number of simulated states.

    simulation_spacemap preserves the function signature and allows the function to be
    called with keyword arguments.

    Args:
        func: The function to be dispatched.
        choices_var_names: Names of the choice variables, i.e. those that are stored as
            arrays of possible values in the grid, over which we create a Cartesian
            product.
        states_var_names: Names of the state variables, i.e. those that are stored as
            arrays of possible states.

    Returns:
        A callable with the same arguments as func (but with an additional leading
        dimension) that returns an Array or pytree of Arrays. If `func` returns a
        scalar, the dispatched function returns an Array with k + 1 dimensions, where k
        is the length of `choices_var_names` and the additional dimension corresponds to
        the `states_var_names`. The order of the dimensions is determined by the order
        of `choices_var_names`. If the output of `func` is a jax pytree, the usual jax
        behavior applies, i.e. the leading dimensions of all arrays in the pytree are as
