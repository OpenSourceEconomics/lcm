    """Generate pseudo-random number generator keys (PRNG keys) for simulation.

    PRNG keys in JAX are immutable objects used to control random number generation.
    A key can be used to generate a stream of random numbers, e.g., given a key, one can
    call jax.random.normal(key) to generate a stream of normal random numbers. In order
    to ensure that each simulation is based on a different stream of random numbers, we
    split the key into one key per stochastic variable, and one key that will be passed
    to the next iteration in order to generate new keys.

    See the JAX documentation for more details:
    https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/random-numbers.html#random-numbers-in-jax

        key: Random key.
